// Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

// let car = 'subaru';

// console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

// console.log(car == 'subaru')

// • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

// • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.

//Making a Variable
let userName:string = "Ayesha Shakoor";
let passWord:number = 121452;

//Text One 
console.log("Test 1: userName is equal to Ayesha Shakoor?");
console.log(userName == "Ayesha Shakoor");

//Text Two 
console.log("\nTest 2: passWord is equal to 121452");
console.log(passWord == 121452);

//Test Three
console.log("\nTest 3: passWord is not equal to 555342");
console.log(passWord != 555342);

//Test Four
console.log("\nTest 4: userName is not equal to Bisma Khan");
console.log(userName != "Bisma khan");

//Test Five
console.log("Test 5: userName & passWord both are equal");
console.log(userName == "Ayesha Shakoor" && passWord == 121452);

//Test Six
console.log("\nTest 6: userName is not correct");
console.log(userName == "bisma khan");

//Test Seven
console.log("\nTest 7: passWord is not correct");
console.log(passWord == 24314);

//Test Eight
console.log("\nTest 8: userName & passWord both are not equal");
console.log(userName != "Ayesha Shakoor" && passWord != 121452);

// Test Nine
console.log("\nTest 9: passWord greater than 500000");
console.log(passWord >= 500000);

//Test Ten
console.log("\nTest 10: passWord less than 60");
