// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

import { resolveObjectURL } from "buffer";


//Array of magicians names
const magicianNames: string[] = ["Derren Brown", "David Blaine", "Harry Houdini", "Criss Angel", "David Copperfield"];

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]): void
{
    for (const magician of magicians) {
        console.log(magician);
    }
}

function make_great(magicians: string[]): string[] {
    const greatMagicians: string[] = magicians.map(magician => `the Great ${magician}`);
    return greatMagicians;
}


//Modify the array to add "the Great" to each magician's name
const greatMagicianNames: string[] = make_great(magicianNames);

// Call the function to show the original magician's names
console.log("Original Magicians:");
show_magicians(magicianNames);

// call the function to show the great magician's names
console.log("\nGreat Magicians:");
