// Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

let guestList = ["Ameen Alam", "Hina Naseer", "Ayesha", "Hafsa"];

guestList.forEach(inviteGuest => console.log(`Hello Dear ${inviteGuest}, you are invited to dinner plz join us.`));
